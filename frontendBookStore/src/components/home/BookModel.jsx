          Setting: Long Island and New York City during the 1920s Critical
          Review: "The Great Gatsby" is widely regarded as one of the greatest
          American novels of the 20th century. F. Scott Fitzgerald's prose
          captures the essence of the Jazz Age, while his exploration of social
          class and moral decay continues to resonate with readers today. The
          novel's tragic ending and timeless themes make it a must-read for
          anyone interested in American literature.
